Perhaps the best-remembered of all TI-99\/4A games, it is a side-scrolling shooter, programmed in 1982 by Jim Dramis (who also programmed the popular TI-99\/4A games Car Wars and Munch Man) and Paul Urbanus.\n\nThe player in Parsec pilots a spaceship through sixteen differently-colored levels of play which scroll horizontally over the screen. The objective is to avoid being shot by an enemy ship, colliding with any flying object and\/or the ground, and destroy all enemy ships without overheating one's laser cannon.\n\nThree waves of fighters attack, alternating with three waves of cruisers. Enemy ships enter the screen one at a time. A ship flying off the left edge of the screen wraps around to the right side and attacks again. A new fighter can appear with others still on the screen, whereas a new cruiser will not come until the previous one is destroyed. The fighters pose only the threat of collision, while the cruisers fire on the player's ship. The fighter types are named Swoopers, LTFs (Light Triangular Fighters), and Saucers. The cruisers are called Urbites, Dramites, and Bynites. Each level ends with an asteroid belt, in which an array of asteroids advance on the ship and must be avoided or shot. At the end of each asteroid belt, any remaining asteroids are cleared away and the color of the ground is changed, then a new wave of Swoopers begins. Starting with level 4, the Swoopers are preceded by a random number of Killer Satellites, which come without the usual computer warning.\n\nThe Urbites and Dramites appear to be named after the developers of the game, while the Bynites were apparently named after Don Bynum (the manager of TI's Personal Computer Division) or possibly named after the fact that they have invisibility (by night). In fact, Paul Urbanus signed Internet posts as late as 2005 as \"urbite\".","themes":[1,18],"updated_at":1723419217,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/parsec","websites":[352576],"checksum":"54c9edda-1960-8507-1579-e5e0aac87f9e","game_type":0,"first_release_date":410140800.0,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":null,"artworks":null,"external_games":[152894,59036,1709730],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[34257],"similar_games":[111846,43367,55038,22799,105269,68286,107318,103301,57187,113362],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871859,536876869],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":[109440],"language_supports":[939532,1051419],"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution.\n\nCompleted puzzles are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same 9x9 playing board row or column or in any of the nine 3x3 subregions of the 9x9 playing board.\n\nThe puzzle was popularized in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning single number.

This approach was meant to have the emulations act true to the original versions of these games, and not carry any imperfections direct ports could have introduced.","themes":[1],"updated_at":1759349359,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/williams-digital-arcade","websites":null,"checksum":"810c39ae-3710-3935-e77c-f792669e5346","game_type":3,"first_release_date":788832000.0,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":[170987],"artworks":null,"external_games":null,"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[316189,316190],"similar_games":[87728,43367,112078,15851,113895,56033,103369,90965,119207,121036],"tags":[1,268435489,536871584,536875462],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":null,"language_supports":null,"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

The collection contains:\n\nKlingons: You are a spaceship returning from a mining expedition and you have run into a Battlefleet of Klingons but you have no guns so with your shield you must ram them all. The game is viewed from above with you scrolling down the screen and the Klingons scrolling upwards. You receive extra points for any Battleships or Motherships that you hit.\n\nCrash-Landing: Your spaceship has been hit by a meteor and you are prepared for a crash landing on a planet with the only control you have is using your rockets. The game is text only and you see your fuel levels, velocity, height and the time.\n\nSimon: Based on the classic game where the computer shows you a sequence of colours and you have to input the same sequence. Every time you get the sequence correct, the computer adds another colour to the same sequence.\n\nArtist: A drawing program that allows you to draw pictures and shapes on the screen with a cursor.\n\nUFO: A row of UFO's sit on the top of the screen and your spaceship scrolls from the left of the screen below them, firing one shot at a time to remove parts of the UFO's. Every time you hit a UFO you score a point and you start scrolling from the left of the screen again. Missing a UFO or hitting the right side of the screen loses you points.\n\nCode: Based on the game Mastermind, the computer thinks of a 4 digit number and you have to guess it within a set number of guesses. Once you enter a number the computer tells you which number is correct in the right place and which number is correct in the wrong place.\n\nAsteroids: Your spaceship has hit an asteroid field and like the game Klingons you have no gun but instead of ramming the asteroids you must avoid them for as long as possible.\n\nBomber: The game is viewed from the side as you watch a Bomber fly from left to right across the screen. The land is below with a dam on it and you must drop a bomb to hit the dam. Each dam that you see appears in a different location.\n\nKaleidescope: This is program based on the toy where you see dots moving about the screen making symmetrical shapes. There is no interaction from the player.\n\nGuillotine: A two player game based on the pen and paper game Hangman but instead of saving your self from being hanged you must stop yourself from getting your head chopped off by a Guillotine. Player One enters a word and Player two has to type in letters to guess the word. Get a letter right and it appears in the word but get it wrong and a Guillotine starts to appear.","themes":null,"updated_at":1732117584,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/10-games","websites":null,"checksum":"1bf9f848-3c1e-4c11-1a24-88549a4dfcc4","game_type":0,"first_release_date":378604800.0,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":null,"artworks":null,"external_games":[2963535],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[291143],"similar_games":[321783,319582,319564,319562,319533,319526,259411,79223,79018,78557],"tags":[536871872],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":null,"language_supports":null,"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

The player may choose one of seven Mario characters, including Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Toad, and Donkey Kong Jr., all with differing attributes in regards to \"speed\", \"power\" or \"racket area\". Either a single game, or a three-game tournament mode may be chosen, both having the option to play either singles or doubles matches on easy, normal, or hard difficulties.

The captain's log and the crew's personal effects were found on board. The cargo was intact. There was an unfinished letter on the mate's desk, the imprint of a child's head on a pillow on one of the bunks. To this day, no one knows what became of the captain, his family and the crew of seven.\nWhen the first humans landed on Argilus on 24 June 2083, they found towns, cities, evidence of fascinating alien technology, but all abandoned, with clear signs that the inhabitants had only just departed. Doors were unlocked, meals unfinished. Amazing machinery was still working away. But no people. It was like discovering the Mary Celeste on a planetary scale.\nEarth Central wanted answers. The planet was classified Restricted and put under immediate quarantine. Experts were sent in. Three science teams - nearly a hundred of Earth's finest first contact specialists - set up science and monitoring outposts at three promising locations: Base One at Bosh's Tunnels, under Dr Angela Davies, Base Two at Symphony Harbor, under Dr Gustav Tomlin, and Base Three at Rainbow Landing, under Dr Frances Bremmer.\nBecause of a particularly active planetary magnetosphere, the surface teams found it impossible to contact Earth directly. Though able to make limited radio contact with one another, the constant electromagnetic interference in the atmosphere prevented messages being routed through the orbital beacon in the usual manner. At first, eager mission leaders could use shuttles to return to the orbiting expedition base ship, Tarquin, and broadcast from there, but twenty days after the expedition's arrival, Tarquin fell silent and vanished from surface radar scans. It had either left the area or - an alarming prospect - had been destroyed in orbit. The teams on Argilus were effectively cut off from Earth.\nThat was just the beginning. Scientists began to go missing. One by one, wherever they were working, alone or in company, personnel at all three bases started disappearing. Was it something they touched, some device they activated, some secret they discovered? No one could say. Every day, the survivors were faced with the nightmare of discovering who had vanished this time, and were left frantically, desperately, uselessly seeking answers.\nNow, four months later, the mission supply ship Angel approaches Argilus to make the first follow-up contact, but its crew - experienced spacers and xeno specialists Sam Mainey and Hannah Grant - can't raise any response from the planetary bases. There is no sign at all of the expedition mothership.\nKnowing that communication from the surface is difficult, and following special ECS mission directives, Captain Mainey takes Angel into a much closer orbit than usual, to where Angel's enhanced com systems should be able to raise someone. There's still no response. Bounceback signatures are positive. Com systems seem to be online and operational, but no-one answers. It's as if the Earth science teams have simply vanished.\nSam and Hannah know what they must do. Given the circumstances, standard ECS procedure is to abort the landing, withdraw to a safe distance and await instructions. But the moment they try to pull back to where they can notify Earth of what has happened, Angel's main systems fail. Com and engines are out. Life support is falling to critical. The ship's orbit is beginning to decay.\nSam Mainey and Hannah Grant have no choice but to use the life-pods and abandon ship, even though they have not yet received the classified 902 mission briefing they were meant to get once contact with the scientists had been made.\n\n​ STRANGE NEW WORLD\nThough Sam and Hannah agree to rendezvous at Base One, and adjust their life-pods' comp systems accordingly, weather and electromagnetic variables cause them to land quite some distance from each other, so their first exposure to the new world finds them on their own.\nHannah lands on a fascinating living ship adrift in the middle of the Great Northern Ocean, and Sam on one of a cluster of balloons floating high above one of the continents. Though their radio links are operational, they both quickly find that the atmospheric interference makes communication impossible. They set their links on record, both as a routine mission log for those back home and in case their missing crewmate can access the data later. Then, with no other choice, they begin exploring this strange new world.\nWith Sam and Hannah, you will experience every step of this fascinating journey of discovery, face their problems, share their successes and disappointments. With luck and skill, you might even unlock the ultimate mystery of Argilus.","age_ratings":[65864],"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":[146420],"artworks":[53829],"external_games":[2068227,1708827,148914,2127149],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[108082,108085,153321],"similar_games":[236,28070,27266,27725,26223,25646,25222,105269,81275,55038],"tags":[18,268435465,268435487,536921413],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":[55896],"language_supports":[334318,334321,334309,334311,334317,334313,334310,334316,334319,334322,334320,476627,334323,334303,334302,334304,334307,334306,334305,334308],"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":[159686],"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

The ancients sought to utilize Gan as a weapon; in doing so, their perverse intentions spawned the malignant ‘Gan-Ti’, or ‘anti-life’. Infusing Gan-Ti into artifacts, the godlike High Kings ruled the Panduran Archipelago with an iron fist. Eventually, rebellion arose and the Order of Archkeepers was formed of the most noble warriors to free the people. They managed to capture the relics of Gan-Ti and cast them into the fiery pits of Mt. Suvius near the shores of Oria island. With the evil power of the relics suppressed, the monsters that terrorized the countryside were slain and the old Kings overthrown. Peace had come. As of late, however, rumblings have been heard from Mt. Suvius, and the wise have come to fear an eruption. With a reckless young King having just assumed the throne of Oria, will the powers of Gan-Ti again fall into the hands of the most powerful, or can a new force arise to combat the inevitable?","age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":[184175],"artworks":[31942],"external_games":[1975965,10950],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[32199],"similar_games":[96217,106987,28309,80916,30245,113360,105269,111130,25311,107318],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,268435488],"total_rating":70.0,"total_rating_count":0.0,"videos":null,"language_supports":[398323,398327,398333,398336,398319,398321,398325,398330,398335],"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":70.0,"rating_count":0.0,"collections":null,"status":4.0,"game_status":4.0,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

P. Lovecraft developed for mobile phones. The game takes place in Cairo in the 1930s. The protagonist is a student of a professor who gets a letter from his teacher asking him to come to Cairo ASAP as he has uncovered something extraordinary and fears that he is in danger. Balthazar Carter arrives only to find that his professor had gone insane and the expedition is put on hold. The new director is known to be interested in the occult and doesn't take kindly to Balthazar's curiosity. Being an expert in old Religions, players will need to help Balthazar uncover what happened to the professor, what was the find as well as the mysteries of an ancient religion which worships the god Cthulhu.\n\nThe game plays out as a point-and-click adventure, but instead of a mouse interface, players control the protagonist directly with him walking to the direction key players have pressed. Players are hinted when they're close to usable objects or people and can trigger a menu where they can choose what they want to do with the objects. Players can pick up and use items and during their adventures they will see a lot of cutscenes of what's going on in the city. Players switch to a top-down view when traveling through the city. The buildings players have access to are indicated with an icon.","themes":null,"updated_at":1671026103,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/call-of-cthulhu-the-darkness-within-book-1","websites":[511307],"checksum":"bd883abf-d1cf-747f-5a16-ab7dec21f105","game_type":0,"first_release_date":1199059200.0,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":null,"artworks":null,"external_games":[2632459],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[195450],"similar_games":null,"tags":null,"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":[80427],"language_supports":null,"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.\n\nZak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.\n\nThe FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.","themes":[18,27],"updated_at":1762324313,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders","websites":[343561,97953,119946,196053],"checksum":"fab71ea1-6c1d-2cca-5ee8-f8e6713badc9","game_type":0,"first_release_date":591667200.0,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":null,"artworks":null,"external_games":[78528,16873,1185426,150903,1683370],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[54159,54157,54158],"similar_games":[192,193,11270,7386,10232,59287,8072,2939,895,62],"tags":[18,27,268435458,268435487,536870915,536871400,536871470,536871599,536871641,536871751,536871874,536872098,536872140,536872550,536872611,536872617,536872898,536873082,536873753,536873874,536874115,536874140,536875050,536875264,536875300,536875310,536875322,536875499,536875533,536876076,536876126,536876334,536876453,536876571,536877758,536877960,536878024,536878138,536878470,536878555,536881937,536882730,536885090,536894845,536920238,536921413],"total_rating":72.6864723781,"total_rating_count":40.0,"videos":null,"language_supports":[108086],"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":72.6864723781,"rating_count":40.0,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":[98919,79531],"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light.","age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":[76509,76510],"artworks":null,"external_games":null,"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[154063,154450],"similar_games":[96217,106987,81249,103303,113360,55038,103168,19164,27092,55199],"tags":[1,17,268435487,536896176,536901988],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":[57314],"language_supports":[515271,515272,515273],"game_localizations":[16028],"franchises":[596],"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":8.0,"game_status":8.0,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

Live commentator is present, but doesn't comment on everything but only on key elements as well as addressing players by their actual names. Camera isn't fixed and adjusts during gameplay to best show the current action, switches to back view for free kicks and penalties, zooms out if the ball is too high to show both the kicker and the ball, and otherwise works as an action camera slightly rotating angles and using zoom automatically instead of just scrolling over the soccer field. Before engaging in a match with another player or the CPU, player can also do training with a selected team where only your team players are on the field where one can test all the moves and learn the ropes. Penalty kicks are also available for practice, but it includes two teams aiming to score five goals first.","themes":null,"updated_at":1739946750,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/jleague-jikkyou-winning-eleven-3","websites":null,"checksum":"007be59e-e59b-6861-3d0c-0e8ce68aff13","game_type":11,"first_release_date":910828800.0,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":[109191],"artworks":null,"external_games":null,"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[222215],"similar_games":[116353,116352,116350,116349,116351,116343,93920,114286,109606,116575],"tags":[268435470],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":null,"language_supports":null,"game_localizations":[2416],"franchises":[3032],"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":[8367],"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

Dive bombing and level bombing techniques have to be worked out by the game player if they are to have success at completing missions.\n\nUS Air to Air missiles in the game consist of early versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-4 Falcon which are simulated to be as unreliable as the real missiles were. So regardless of having a \"good lock on the target\" there is a good chance the missile will miss. Just like the real accounts from the war suggest most of the dogfights are close in affairs with the nimble MiGs against the heavier less nimble US Aircraft.\n\nThe map of Vietnam has been scaled down slightly so that there is less time spent flying to a target, and also because air-to-air refuelling is not included in the game.\n\nDuring a mission the player will fly in a flight of aircraft in which the computer-controlled planes keep in formation as you fly to a target.

As you fly many other computer-controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets.\n\nTrue to the Vietnam theatre the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAMS), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAM is the soviet SA-2, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly.\n\nThe player can select a campaign from either Operation Rolling Thunder (1965 to 1968), Linebacker I (1972) or Linebacker II (1972) which are similar in name and aircraft involved to the actual campaigns from the conflict.\n\nSingle Missions are also available, which can be customised to allow the player to practice with specific aircraft and weapons.","themes":null,"updated_at":1706207875,"url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/wings-over-vietnam","websites":[5733,393417],"checksum":"24031ba4-0d61-66b9-4bcd-87324f31c6f5","game_type":0,"first_release_date":null,"storyline":null,"age_ratings":[61584],"aggregated_rating":49.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1.0,"alternative_names":[17977,5992],"artworks":null,"external_games":[1919125,152830],"hypes":3.0,"involved_companies":null,"similar_games":[73994,119295,71051,69416,68270,67637,60676,61334,59352,59351],"tags":[268435469,536870968,536871546,536871904,536873753,536874743,536877511],"total_rating":49.0,"total_rating_count":1.0,"videos":null,"language_supports":null,"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":[3462],"status":2.0,"game_status":2.0,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

As science has reached unprecedented heights, people across the globe have become more united, forgetting about age-old conflicts and feuds.\n\nHowever, along with great discoveries, new troubles appeared in people's lives.

Its power is immeasurable, and its intentions are unknown.\n\nThe player will take control of a spaceship as the captain of Space Fleet Command, James Dekker. Together with a team of recruits, on a battle-worn ship, you will look into the most remote corners of the galaxy, engage in fierce space combat, fight with entire fleets, and protect not only the Earth but all of humanity.","age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":null,"artworks":[49576],"external_games":[2116671,2076380],"hypes":1.0,"involved_companies":[302807],"similar_games":[111130,96217,113895,106987,28309,25646,87622,80916,68271,30245],"tags":[1,268435487,268435488],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":[137769,137770],"language_supports":[355544,355540,355541,355542,355543],"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}

Our protagonist has just arrived in the Big City by bus with the intention of getting employed in the Stain Financial company. On his way to the company's office building, he finds a shiny quarter. He gets past the security check and enters the building, where a friendly female secretary greets and urges him to wait for his interview on the couch. There he meets a man dressed as a cowboy and after a brief dialogue, the secretary instructs the protagonist to follow her to M. Stain's room. At the end of the long hallway, she opens the door to his room and leaves the protagonist alone. M. Stain, a millionaire playboy tycoon, politely greets the hero and offers him a seat on one of the two chairs in front of his table. The choice is pointless, as M. Stain's reaction is virtually the same, regardless of which chair we chose. He then asks the protagonist if he's comfortable and whether he replies positively or negatively, M. Stain's answer will be reassuring and understandable. Next, he asks if the protagonist knows what M stands for in his name. According to himself, it actually stands for nothing. After that, M. Stain proceeds to show us his three most prized possessions: a carved ivory fox, an antique newspaper and a well-worn saw, for us to select an item that describes our personality the best. Although his reactions are different with the pick of each item, in the end he still offers us to sign a contract in a very limited amount of time, in order for the protagonist to be unaware of it's questionable contents. If you fail to sign it on time or refuse, M. Stain will get furious and suggest that you \"need some time to think it over\", then presses a button on his table which opens a trap door under the protagonist's chair, sending him into an underground cell. In a cell on the opposite side is the already familiar to us man in the cowboy clothes, who apparently was also imprisoned by M. Stain. In our cell is some kind of a lever with the words \"save yourself\" written in blood above it. When the lever is pushed, the cowboy man shouts in distress and pleads with the hero to switch it off, as the lever has activated the spiked wall which is now coming towards the cowboy man. He's eventually crushed by the wall and we see his angry spirit leaving his body, floating towards the protagonist. Nonetheless, an elevator descends from the hole we have just fallen through and saves him from the spirit. When the hero reaches M. Stain's office, he's already gone and the hallway that we previously came through is completely different from what it used to be, with the red walls, ceiling fans humming ominously and massive fleshy growths ornating the doorway. After going down the hallway to the very end, the hero realizes that he just came back into the same office, however this time one of M. Stain prized items is lying on the floor, which one depends on the protagonist's choice. Upon interacting with it, the whole room suddenly turns black and we are inexplicably teleported to the entirely different location, near the gates of M. Stain's estate. M. Stain himself is standing next to his limousine, inviting the hero to enter the car. Note, that even if we were to sign the contract, this part will be the same, only without the protagonist being dropped into the dungeon and forced to kill the cowboy man to escape.\n\nAfter a short ride, the limousine stops near \"The Final Sacrifice\" bar. Since an invisible force is blocking our way out, the hero is forced to enter the club. The club is filled with indistinguishable people drinking and chatting. On the counter lies someone's forgotten dollar. The protagonist grabs the dollar and comes towards the weird jittery bartender. He offers you a complimentary drink from the bar for free. If you choose to taste it and then ask if the bartender wants a tip, he will refuse and instead ask you to play his favorite song \"Ol' Ramblin' Rattler\". You insert the previously found quarter into the jukebox and the song starts playing. All of a sudden, the bartender says that he wants to be completely bold with you, his head pops off like a hollow mask and a snake shows up in its place, saying that you should \"kill him the first chance you get\", possibly referring to M. Stain, and vanishes. Perturbed by this occurrence, the hero goes into the bathroom, only to find an inexplicably appearing eviscerated goat on the toilet in the second stall and words \"save yourself\" written in blood, just like in M. Stain's dungeon. For whatever reason he grabs the dead goat and finds a key to the room 3A in the toilet. With nothing important left to do in the bar area, he walks the stairs down into the arcade, filled with many locked doors, club music and suggestive moans. Entrance to the VIP area is guarded by the masked bouncer telling the hero that he should get the membership card to get there. Using his key, the protagonist enters the room 3A, where he finds a television set embedded into the wall that requires one dollar. After inserting the dollar and watching one of the three minute-long bizarre erotic films, he hears someone knocking on the wall from the nearby room. A skeletal arm holding a knife slowly sticks out of the wall. The hero arms himself with the mentioned knife and then hears a wall phone near his door ringing. He answers the call and hears only static for about half a minute, but in the end a disembodied voice informs him of someone standing behind him. Indeed, one of the doors behind us is open, with a raven sitting next to the bed with the membership card lying on it. The hero approaches the raven, with the latter suddenly flying right into his face and vanishing like an illusion. Regardless, the protagonist acquires the card and shows it to the masked guard, then enters the VIP area.\n\nIn front of him extends a vast room with ornaments on the walls, stained glass windows, two rows of benches and a pedestal in the far end, behind which is standing M. Stain himself, greeting the protagonist. After he comes closer to the pedestal and an altar beneath it, he notices a group of silent robed children with greenish skin and black holes for eyes. To the right of M. Stain is standing a robed figure with it's face obscured by the hood. M. Stain wishes to initiate the protagonist into his cult, but in order for that to happen he has to make a sacrifice. Having only a dead goat found in the bathroom stall earlier, he places it on the altar. M. Stain is displeased, noting that something greater is required. A robed figure to the right of him volunteers to become the sacrifice, drops the rob and turns out to be a completely naked female secretary from the beginning. M. Stain agrees and she happily lays onto the altar. Here, the hero has to choose whether to stab the woman or M. Stain himself in the back. Here, the hero has to choose whether to stab the woman on the altar or M. Stain himself in the back. Either way, if we stab the girl, the idol that they were making a sacrifice to will deem her spirit to be unclean and strike M. Stain through his back. If M. Stain was killed by the protagonist instead, the idol will incinerate the girl on the altar. Upon perishing through one of these ways, M. Stain's body will start glowing, then will be turn to shreds and the remains of it transform into the flying demonic beast with upper part of M. Stain's head and some of his internal organs. The hero is then forced into the center of the room and encircled by the mysteriously repositioned benches. After stabbing M. Stain several times, he falls to the ground and explodes, with the idol in the background collapsing as well, making the entire building burst into flames. The hero barely manages to escape the building before it goes down in flames. When outside, he hears the taxi signalling him from the nearby road and jumps into it without thinking. Depending on the protagonist's actions, the car's driver is either the female secretary's spirit, if he chose to stab her when she was lying on the altar, the cowboy's spirit, if he refused the contract and was forced to kill him in the dungeon, or a regular taxi driver, in case he harmed no one except M. Stain.","age_ratings":null,"aggregated_rating":null,"aggregated_rating_count":null,"alternative_names":null,"artworks":[55060],"external_games":[2011519,2131062],"hypes":null,"involved_companies":[305393],"similar_games":[26658,111130,120201,99307,110737,55282,13189,11668,25646,25222],"tags":[19,21,268435488,536871132,536872225,536872633,536873137],"total_rating":null,"total_rating_count":null,"videos":[49277],"language_supports":null,"game_localizations":null,"franchises":null,"rating":null,"rating_count":null,"collections":null,"status":null,"game_status":null,"multiplayer_modes":null,"bundles":null,"dlcs":null,"ports":null,"expanded_games":null,"version_parent":null,"version_title":null,"expansions":null,"remakes":null,"franchise":null,"standalone_expansions":null,"remasters":null,"category":null}
